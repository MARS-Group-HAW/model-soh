<h1 align="center">SmartOpenHH MultimodalModel</h1>

This folder contains a library that allows for the design of an agent that can use multiple entity types (by switching
back and forth between them during travel). The library is suited for models that aim to simulate and study travel
patterns and behavior as well as other aspects that emerge as a result of having multiple modalities (`Car`, `Bicycle`,
and travel on foot) available. It also includes a traffic light component.
