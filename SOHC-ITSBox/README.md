## Project: Smart-Open-Hamburg Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems
___

### Overview and Objective

#### What is a C-ITS?
A Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) extends the concept of Intelligent Transport Systems by enabling communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and other road users. This cooperation enhances the overall efficiency and safety of the transport system.

Currently, a prototype of a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is being developed in Hamburg. However, the impact of features such as automatic traffic light phase changes upon the approach of buses and emergency services (police and ambulances) on city traffic remains unclear.

**Objective**  
The goal of this project is to add the necessary elements to the Smart Open Hansestadt Hamburg (SOHH) project to conduct a study through simulations.

## ModelDescription
___
This section should describe the model used in the project, including its components and how they interact.

## Globals
___
This section should list and describe any global variables or settings used throughout the project.

## Layer Mappings
___
This section should explain the mappings between different layers in the project, detailing how data flows between them.

## AgentMappings
___
This section should describe the mappings for different agents within the project, including their roles and interactions.
